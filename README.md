# Brighter API Interface

A front-end interface for the Brighter API, enabling CRUD operations on data from the new MMO Brighter Shores.

## Description

The Brighter API Interface provides a user-friendly way to interact with the [Brighter API](https://github.com/jrbarnhart/brighter-api). It offers a dashboard overview of the data served by the API, along with comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities for managing that data. Leveraging type generation from the API's OpenAPI specification, this interface ensures type safety and allows for a (relatively) smooth development experience.

## Key Features

- **Dashboard:** Provides a statistical overview of the data managed by the Brighter API.
- **CRUD Operations:** Full support for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records of all types served by the Brighter API.
- **Auth:** Write operations require login to the Brighter API.
- **Index Pages:** List all records for each data type.
- **Detailed Views:** Display individual records with comprehensive details and an update form.
- **Creation Forms:** Facilitate the creation of new records.
- **Type Safety:** Utilizes `openapi-typescript` and `openapi-zod-client` to generate types and schemas directly from the Brighter API's OpenAPI JSON, ensuring type safety throughout the application.
- **Efficient Data Fetching:** Employs `tanstack-query` and `axios` for streamlined and typed API requests.
- **Form Management:** Leverages `react-hook-form` with `zodResolver` for robust form handling and validation, using schemas generated by `openapi-zod-client`.
- **Modern Tooling:** Built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS for a modern and performant development experience.
- **Client-Side Routing:** Uses `react-router-dom` for smooth navigation.
- **UI Components:** Utilizes `shadcn/ui` components for a consistent and polished user interface.
